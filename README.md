## 📈 **Performance**

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **Search** → Opens Google Maps & searches your keyword
2. **Scroll** → Loads all available results (not just first page)
3. **Extract** → Gets name, phone, website, address
4. **Email Mine** → Visits websites & extracts emails (optional)
5. **Deduplicate** → Removes duplicates & validates data
6. **Export** → Saves as CSV & JSON

## 📁 **Output Files**

```
output/
├── businesses.csv      ← Open in Excel
└── businesses.json     ← Use in APIs

logs/
└── scraper_*.log       ← Debugging info
```

---

## 💻 **Command Line (Advanced)**

If you prefer terminal:

```bash
# Basic search
python maps_scraper.py --keyword "Restaurant" --city "New York"

# With limits
python maps_scraper.py --keyword "Cafe" --city "London" --max-results 50

# Fast mode (no emails)
python maps_scraper.py --keyword "Gym" --city "Paris" --no-emails --headless

# Resume from checkpoint
python maps_scraper.py --keyword "Plumber" --city "Mumbai" --resume --timeout 900
```

---

## ⚡ **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Start with 10 results** → Test before big scrape
2. **Use headless mode** → 2-3x faster (default: ON)
3. **Skip emails first** → Get all businesses, extract emails later
4. **Specific keywords work better** → "Italian Restaurant" > "Restaurant"
5. **Run at off-hours** → Less chance of getting blocked

---

## ⚠️ **Important**

- ✅ Legal for personal/business use
- ✅ Respects rate limits (built-in delays)
- ⚠️ Don't scrape too aggressively (may get IP blocked)
- 💡 Consider proxies for large-scale scraping

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No results found | Try simpler keyword or different city |
| Very slow | Enable "Skip Emails", reduce timeout |
| Getting blocked | Wait 2-3 hours, try different city |
| Crashes midway | Use "Resume" feature to continue |
